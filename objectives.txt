We would like you to prepare a hardhat project(+ points if it uses typescript).
That project should implement a really simple AMM where:
1. Only the contract creator can supply initial liquidity.
    Done
2. The tokens traded on the AMM are IERC20.
    Done
3. Only 2 tokens are inside the pool. 
    Done 
    I've used Ether and tokenA
    If asked, I'll switch out Ether with tokenB
4. Any external actor can come to the AMM and swap token A to token B and vice versa.
    Done
5. The initial price is tokenASupplied / tokenBSupplied.
    Done
6. Any trade should move the price.
    Done
7.  A 0.5% fee is taken on each swap.
    Done

Also include as much tests as possible.
Additional points will be given for a Kovan deployment.

# About the project üçæ

Aiming to build a simple AMM where: 
1. Only the contract creator can supply initial liquidity.
2. The tokens traded on the AMM are IERC20.
3. Only 2 tokens are inside the pool.
4. Any external actor can come to the AMM and swap token A to token B and vice versa.
5. The initial price is tokenASupplied / tokenBSupplied.
6. Any trade should move the price.
7.  A 0.5% fee is taken on each swap.
